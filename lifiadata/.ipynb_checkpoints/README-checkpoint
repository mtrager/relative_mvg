This directory contains 3 sub-directories :

House : contains two files :
		       1- images_seq.tar.gz: contains a sequence of nine grey
		          level images of the scene house. These images were
			  used for reconstruction experiments, the tracked
			  points of this sequence can be found in house.tar.gz
		       2- house.tar.gz: a set of date (tracked and 3D
		          reconstruction) cooresponding to the image sequence
			  of images_seq.tar.gz, it contains its own README.

Bridge : contains
             1- a sequence of 3 images of an outdour scene (Grenoble, France)
	        bridge_1.pbm, bridge_2.pbm and bridge_3.pbm.
	     2- a pair of rectified images: bridge_1_2.rec.pbm (bridge_1.pbm
	        and bridge_2.pbm) with some epipolar lines, note that for that
		case the epipolar lines are horizontal.
	     3- three files: track1, track2 and track3 containing tracked 2D
	        images coordinates through the images bridge_1.pbm,
		bridge_2.pbm and bridge_3.pbm respectively.
	     4- a set of fundamental matrices relating image pairs.

Tribunal : contains
             1- an image pair of an outdour scene (Grenoble, France)
	        trib_1.pbm and trib_2.pbm.
	     2- the same image pair : trib_1_2.pbm (trib_1.pbm and trib_2.pbm)
	        with some epipolar lines.
	     3- the same image pair but  after rectification: trib_1_2.rec.pbm
	        (trib_1.pbm and trib_2.pbm) with some epipolar lines, note
		that for that case the epipolar lines are horizontal.
	     4- two files: track1 and track2 containing tracked 2D
	        images coordinates through the images trib_1.pbm and
		trib_2.pbm respectively.
	     5- a set of fundamental matrices relating image pairs.


PS: 1- a pair of images is said rectified when the images are transformed
       such that the epipolar lines are horizontal.
    2- all images are in pbm format and have the suffix .pbm, they could be
       read using xv software.
